# Homebridge MQTT-Thing: Release Notes

### Version 1.1.27
+ Added support for adaptive lighting

### Version 1.1.26 (Beta)
+ Weather Station: added ambient light level (thanks, Matt Kirman)
+ Validate characteristics when setting to avoid Homebridge 1.3 warnings
+ Lock/unlock fix with Siri and Homebridge 1.3.x (thanks, @tasict)

### Version 1.1.25
+ Fan: When setRotationSpeed is configured but not setOn, turn fan off with zero rotation speed (https://github.com/arachnetech/homebridge-mqttthing/issues/358 and https://github.com/arachnetech/homebridge-mqttthing/issues/310)
+ Lightbulb: Change `whiteMix` to `noWhiteMix` for configuration schema as items defaulting to true are populated when irrelevant
+ Fan: Tested minRotationSpeed/maxRotationSpeed - Homekit apparently doesn't like this changed
+ Added debounceRecvms setting

### Version 1.1.24
+ Lightbulb: Allow lightbulb-Dimmable to use setBrightness only (0 brightness for off) when no setOn topic configured

### Version 1.1.23
+ Thermostat: Fixed target relative humidity
+ Changed incorrect 'http' protocol in MQTT server configuration to 'mqtt' (thanks, Nicholas Humfrey)

### Version 1.1.22
+ Light: Added redThreshold, greenThreshold, blueThreshold for when whiteMix is false in an RGBWW light
+ Light: Added minColorTemperature and maxColorTemperature configuration settings
+ Light: Added switchWhites setting for RGBWW light

### Version 1.1.21
+ Updated fakegato-history dependency version
+ Added whiteMix option to configuration schema
+ Fixed publishing confirmation with Boolean values (https://github.com/arachnetech/homebridge-mqttthing/issues/363)

### Version 1.1.20
+ Added insecure option for TLS, disabling checking of certificate and server identity

### Version 1.1.19
+ Allowed TLS certificate, key and ca pem files to be loaded

### Version 1.1.18
+ Added whiteMix option for RGBWW lights. Set whiteMix to false to disable extraction of white components from colours - i.e. powering only RGB channels or WW,CW channels. (https://github.com/arachnetech/homebridge-mqttthing/issues/300)

### Version 1.1.17 (TEST BUILD)
+ Added support for grouped (custom) accessories (https://github.com/arachnetech/homebridge-mqttthing/issues/201)

### Version 1.1.16
+ Changed order of Codec and apply() used together so that on publishing values pass through apply function before codec, and on subscription values pass through codec before apply function. This allows manipulation of values like the red,green,blue string from the RGB light before codec encoding and after codec decoding. This makes the JSON codec more flexible.

### Version 1.1.15
+ Fixed weather station with homebridge-lib 4.7.7

### Version 1.1.14
+ Added air purifier (implemented by @tobekas)
+ Added irrigation system (implemented by @tobekas)
+ JSON codec: added per-topic fixed values and retain option

### Version 1.1.13
+ When using missing confirmation to set offline state, any message received after timeout sets state back to online
+ Added internal codec concept: specifying a codec with no .js suffix will load it from the mqttthing 'codecs' directory
+ Added experimental JSON codec (json)
+ RGB and HSV lights: wait for multiple property changes before publishing

### Version 1.1.12
+ Extended codecs to support ad hoc property changes and MQTT publishing
+ Codec defaults changed to apply per-function

### Version 1.1.11
+ Fixed publishing of empty messages configured through config-ui-x in startPub (#253)

### Version 1.1.10
+ Fixed crash (introduced in version 1.1.9) with confirmed publisher on/off acknowledgement (#252)

### Version 1.1.9
+ Added persistencePath to historyOptions
+ Added support for codecs
+ Added state to apply functions

### Version 1.1.8
+ Garage door add getDoorMoving option as simpler alternative to getCurrentDoorState
+ Changed default garage door state (after restart) to closed

### Version 1.1.7
+ Allow temperature sensor current temperature range to be overriden (using minTemperature and maxTemperature)
+ Added confirmationIndicateOffline option
+ Moved history options from history to historyOptions object
+ Added config-ui-x support for historyOptions

### Version 1.1.6
+ Added history support for switch (implemented by @tobekas)
+ Fixed #223 and #207 - history not working if getTotalConsumption used (implemented by @tobekas)
+ Fixed history last activation in motion and contact sensor (implemented by @tobekas)
+ Allowed config.url string without protocol, now defaulting to mqtt:// (implemented by @tobekas)

### Version 1.1.5
+ Don't throw an exception at start-up if the configuration is invalid (as this stops Homebridge unnecessarily)

### Version 1.1.4
+ Fixed excessive MQTT logging (introduced in 1.1.2). Thanks, @nzbullet.

### Version 1.1.3
+ Added lightbulb sub-types to configuration schema, allowing easier configuration of different lightbulb types.
+ Added missing otherValueOff to configuration schema.

### Version 1.1.2
+ Added configuration schema, supporting configuration of most settings through config-ui-x (thanks, @oznu). Note that 'apply' functions are not supported.
+ Added new 'startPub' format, allowing configuration through config-ui-x.

### Version 1.1.1
+ Changed Boolean value handling to support bare JavaScript Booleans returned from incoming MQTT apply() functions (`"true" != true` but both are now accepted).
+ Boolean property values passed to outgoing MQTT apply() functions are no-longer converted to strings first (for consistency with the change above). This allows easier publishing of JSON containing correctly typed values, but **may change outgoing message format with existing configurations in some situations**.
+ Added option to configure garage door target values independently of current values - thanks, Charles Powell

### Version 1.0.50
+ Stateless Programmable Switch: allow multiple buttons under a single switch - thanks, Jacob Nite

### Version 1.0.49
+ Stateless Programmable Switch: added option to restrict available switch values - thanks, Jacob Nite

### Version 1.0.48

+ Added Television (implemented by tobekas)
+ Fix to characteristics with multiple states (thanks, tobekas)

### Version 1.0.41
